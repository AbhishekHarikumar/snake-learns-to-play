Snake Learns to Play 

Business Problem:- 

In the project "Snake Learns to Play," the objective is to automate the classic Snake game using evolutionary algorithms. The challenge lies in effectively tracking and analyzing the performance of the snake controlled by the algorithm across various parameters. A detailed and interactive dashboard is needed to consolidate all relevant performance metrics, offer real-time updates, and enhance data accessibility for stakeholders involved in the project.

Business Solution:-

 Created a comprehensive dashboard for the "Snake Learns to Play" project that tracks Max Score, Min Score, Average Score, Impact of Tournament Size on Score, Learning Curve Max Score, Impact of Neural Network Layers on Score, and Impact on Mutation Score using Power BI.

 Implemented real-time data updates and interactive features, improving data accessibility for stakeholders. Analyzed performance data to identify trends, optimize neural network configurations, and determine the effects of tournament size and mutation on the snake's learning and performance.
